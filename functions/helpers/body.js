            <p>Hello, {{first_name_or_nickname}}, today I want to talk about a phrase used quite often by young ladies back in my day -- in the 1980s and 1990s when I was a single fellow.</p>

            <p>The phrase, “an unaffected man,” seems to have fallen out of favor in this day and age.  People your age might use phrases like “authentic,” “real,” or “genuine” instead.</p>

            <p>Maybe I’m showing my age (58), but I personally prefer “unaffected” because it gets to the heart of the matter of where you want to be as a young man pursuing your “Proverbs 31” bride -- wherever she may reside!</p>

            <p>Any woman, high quality or otherwise, longs for security deep down in the core of her being. When you bring the quality of “an unaffected man” to the table, you place yourself light years ahead of the other fellows out there.</p>

            <p>A woman finds herself swept off her feet by a “pillar-like” character who stands against the winds and the storms, “unaffected” -- or at least seemingly -- by them.</p>
            
            <p>So if you find yourself so often “bending in the wind” and buckling under pressure, just know that whenever you display that aspect of your character, this turns off your potential bride.</p>

            <p>And yet we as men all face “fears within and fears without” that sometimes seem to crush our very souls. How can we do anything but to “cry out in anguish” when real trouble descends upon us -- casting us into our “dark night of the soul?”</p>

            <p>My suggestion to you is twofold:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Cultivate manliness. Workout at the gym, pumping and sweating as you lift those weights. Actions like this will tend to drive out fear. Yes, we can never fully suppress our present crisis that we may live under. But we can deal with the emotions. Straining and hardening your muscles tends to calm you down. And, bonus, the muscle you add to your body tends to act almost like a “suit of armor,” shielding you (both psychologically and physically) from the storms of life.</li>
                <li>Get into the Word of God. I once heard that the Bible contains 365 verses telling you, as the reader, not to fear. I don’t know if that’s the exact count, but it sure does have a lot of them on the subject of fear. Two of my favorites are near the beginning of the Bible</li>
            </ol>

            <ul>
                <li>“After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, FEAR NOT, Abram: I am thy shield, and THY EXCEEDING GREAT REWARD.” (Genesis 15:1)</li>
                <li>“Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; BE NOT AFRAID, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.” (Joshua 1:9)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I capitalized the most powerful parts of these verses to me. I particularly like the fact that God is a person’s “exceeding great reward” -- not just the things God gives. Did you catch that? In other words, if you face a massive financial calamity at your doorstep, you can turn to this verse and say, “Hey, I’ve already got everything I need here. I’ve got God in my life! No matter what happens to me financially, He’s already my reward!”</p>

            <p>Talk about “an unaffected man!” If you were to say that to yourself and to others around you, you sure would look like a “strong pillar of strength” to them -- including to your future bride!</p>

            <p>Three cheers to you, {{first_name_or_nickname}}, the “unaffected man!”</p>
