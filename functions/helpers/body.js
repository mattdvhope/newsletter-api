            "How to Display Your Rare 'Man of Destiny' Quality to Others"
        </h1>

        <div style="font-size: 21px; line-height: 2; color: #333;">
            <p>Hey, you. Yeah, you, friend — Last week I talked about balancing ambition with contentment. I talked about how to avoid the two extremes of The Lazy Dreamer or The Frenzied Workaholic—and how neither one of those qualities will make you attractive to a Proverbs 31 Woman.</p>

            <p>Now, assuming you can strike a balance between the two by becoming a high-achieving man who still enjoys life, how do you get that “quality” of yours across to other people—whether to the woman herself or to “influencers” in her life (which I’ll talk about more next week)?</p>

            <h2 style="font-family: Impact, Georgia, serif; font-size: 25px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;">
                "Ditch Digital Dating and Get Into the REAL WORLD!"
            </h2>

            <p>If you remain inside your “digital bubble” for the rest of your existence on planet earth, the likelihood of your ever meeting a Proverbs 31 woman (much less marrying one) will prove almost nil.</p>

            <p>You’ve got to engage in the culture. And when I say, “engage,” I do not mean digitally. I mean face-to-face, nose-to-nose, toes-to-toes interaction with real flesh-and-blood human beings—week in and week out! And not just at work. You need to break out of your “man cave”—with its screens surrounding you like so many iron prison bars—and get into the REAL WORLD!</p>

            <h2 style="font-family: Impact, Georgia, serif; font-size: 25px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;">
                "Here Are 10 Activities to Start Right Away"
            </h2>

            <ol style="padding-left: 20px;">
                <li>Volunteer for anything (that doesn’t take up too much time)</li>
                <li>Join Toastmasters</li>
                <li>Participate in a Sports League, Pickleball Club, etc</li>
                <li>Join a Hiking or Biking Club</li>
                <li>Join an evening Bible study group</li>
                <li>Take an Evening Graphic Design Class</li>
                <li>Mentor or tutor kids through a school or church</li>
                <li>Join a choir or worship team</li>
                <li>Take part in mission trips or service projects</li>
                <li>Join a local business or entrepreneurial group</li>
            </ol>

            <p>If you brainstorm, you can think of a gazillion other possibilities. Just make sure you don’t join a “Zoom group”—unless it will lead to a face-to-face gathering soon!</p>

            <div style="margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background: #f0f8ff; border-left: 4px solid #007acc; border-radius: 4px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 21px;">
                <strong>Your Action Item:</strong> At whichever gathering you go to, keep your phone in your pocket and your attention focused on the face of the person in front of you. If you run out of things to say, ask lots of questions. People LOVE to talk about themselves.
            </div>

            <p>The more you talk--and, more importantly, listen—the more you GROW as a conversationalist! If you spend a solid year—two or three times per week—in real live conversation with actual human beings, just imagine how you will TRANSFORM your ability to “banter” with other folks. Such a skill will go a long way in preparing you to meet YOUR Proverbs 31 woman!</p>

            </h2>

            <p>What kinds of people do you want to “banter” with?</p>

            <p>Two kinds...</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Possible Proverbs 31 women.</li>
                <li>“Authorities and Influencers” over them.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Next week I’ll talk to you about these all-important “Authorities and Influencers” in your quest for your Proverbs 31 wife!</p>
            
            <p>Until then, get to work—you’re on the path to becoming the man a Proverbs 31 woman has been praying for.</p>
