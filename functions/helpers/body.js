        <h1 style="font-family: Impact, Georgia, serif; font-size: 31px; color: #333; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">"How to Become the Rare Christian Man That a “Proverbs 31 Woman” Can’t Stop Thinking About... Even If You’re Broke, Busy, and Barely Getting By!"</h1>

        <div style="font-size: 21px; line-height: 2; color: #333;">
            <p>Hey, you. Yeah, you -— the man grinding away at his 9-to-5 (or maybe 5-to-9) job and wondering if he’s ever gonna meet “the one.” You’ve been praying, hoping, maybe even staring at your reflection in the coffee shop window, thinking, <em>“Do I have what it takes?”</em></p>

            <p>Well, let me tell you something. You absolutely DO have what it takes if you learn the secret weapon I’m about to share: <strong>balancing ambition with contentment.</strong> Master this, and you’ll become the kind of man a Proverbs 31 woman will want to seriously consider —- the man who’s confident, stable, and going somewhere in life.</p>

            <h2 style="font-family: Impact, Georgia, serif; font-size: 25px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;">"Why Most Men Totally Miss the Boat on This"</h2>

            <p>Let’s get real. Ambition is a rare quality these days. Most men fall into one of two camps:</p>

            <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>The Lazy Dreamer</strong>—always talking about his big plans but never lifting a finger to make them happen.</li>
                <li><strong>The Frenzied Workaholic</strong>—chasing success so hard he forgets to live, let alone leave room for a wife.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Neither of these men is winning hearts. Why? Because women —- especially the high-quality, Proverbs 31 types —- are looking for a man who’s going somewhere but is also content with the journey. They want to feel safe, secure, and inspired -— not dragged along in chaos or stuck in a rut.</p>

            <h2 style="font-family: Impact, Georgia, serif; font-size: 25px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;">"The Foolproof Formula for Cultivating Ambition and Contentment"</h2>

            <p>Here’s how to get this right:</p>

            <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Get Clear on Your Goals:</strong> Write them down. Do you want a better job? A debt-free life? A house for your future family? Make it real.</li>
                <li><strong>Work Your Tail Off:</strong> Sign up for that course, apply for that promotion, or start that side hustle. Move closer to your goal. Use a Goal Card! (<em>I talk about your “Goal Card” a lot in my book!</em>)</li>
                <li><strong>Say “Thanks” Every Day:</strong> Thank God for one specific blessing in your life every morning.</li>
                <li><strong>Intentionally Give Yourself Time Off!:</strong> Make your GOAL this week to give yourself at least one "Sabbath Rest" day. God designed us to work no more than 6 days per week. Give yourself a full day off and enjoy the WONDERFUL effects on your health and happiness!</li>
                <li><strong>Stay Connected to God:</strong> Pray over your plans. Trust His guidance (Proverbs 16:9).</li>
            </ul>

            <div style="margin-top: 20px; padding: 15px; background: #f0f8ff; border-left: 4px solid #007acc; border-radius: 4px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 21px;">
                <strong>Your Action Item:</strong> Set one financial or career goal today. Take one small action toward it -— right now. Open a savings account, research a course, or ask your boss about growth opportunities. Just start. You don't have to set a goal every day, but you can spend every day working on your goal!
